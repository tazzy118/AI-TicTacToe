<h1>AI-TicTacToe ‚ùå‚≠ï</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate my grasp of AI algorithms and machine learning models in the real world as they relate to creating an expert system. I created an AI-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that can handle challenging tasks specifically for this purpose. To show the game's proficiency when combined with my models, the system has a performance evaluation component. This assessment serves as a concrete yardstick for gauging the AI system's performance in real-world situations. The expert system perceives the gaming environment, makes sophisticated analyses of it, and then reacts with well-considered movements in accordance with a Think-Act Cycle. The game is made to work properly in a variety of situations, demonstrating its adaptability to a range of difficultiesüåù
