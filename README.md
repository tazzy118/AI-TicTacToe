<h1>AI-TicTacToe ❌⭕</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In my first year of university, I created the social networking software Virality. I primarily used C#, MySQL, and php. Even though it wasn't flawless, I had a lot of fun making it because it was something new for me and I wanted to push myself. The most enjoyable thing I've done is add an OTP system, which was both cool and really difficult. I did manage to complete it, though, and it made me feel really accomplished. Both the admin and user sides are available. The PDF contains a full description of my software methodology process.
